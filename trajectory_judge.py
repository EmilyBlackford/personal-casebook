- web_search: searches the web for current or general information

Query: {query}

Tool calls made:

Score the appropriateness of the tool selection from 0.0 to 1.0.
1.0 = exactly the right tools were called with precise, relevant queries
0.5 = acceptable but suboptimal (unnecessary extra call, slightly imprecise query)
0.0 = clearly wrong (web search used for a corpus question, or no tools called for a question that needs retrieval)

Return a JSON object with exactly two keys: "score" (a float) and "reasoning" (a string).
