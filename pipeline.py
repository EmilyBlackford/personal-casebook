"""The retrieval pipeline, complete and ready to run.

Nothing in here is left for you to fill in. The lab walks you through it one
step at a time, and you run each step on its own:

    python pipeline.py split                  # cut the corpus into chunks and print the first four
    python pipeline.py split 6                # print chunk 6 and the three after it
    python pipeline.py split-naive            # the same split with the separator list emptied
    python pipeline.py index                  # embed the chunks and store them (run once)
    python pipeline.py retrieve "a question"  # show the passages that come back
    python pipeline.py prompt "a question"    # print the prompt without calling the model
    python pipeline.py ask "a question"       # the whole thing, end to end

Run `index` once. It costs money, takes a couple of minutes, and drops whatever
was in the store before. `split`, `retrieve` and `ask` are cheap and you can run
them as often as you like.

Four values in this file are marked with a DECISION comment, because you get to
choose them and the choice has consequences. The lab shows you what each one does on the sample
corpus, and you choose them properly for Casebook this afternoon.
